# Thales Network

**An Ethereum compatible [Parachain](https://polkadot.network/technology/) built with [Substrate](https://substrate.dev).**

ðŸ‘‰ _Discover the Thales project at [thales.network](https://thales.network)._<br>
ðŸ‘‰ _Learn to [use the Thales network](https://docs.thales.network/) with our technical docs._<br>
ðŸ‘‰ _Reference our [crate-level docs (rustdocs)](https://Thales-network.github.io/thales) to contribute._

## Performance

Thales network focus on performance. Thales network block interval is about 1 second, and TPS will reach 1000+ in 2021 Q3, and will believe TPS will reach 5000+ in 2022 Q2.

## Low cost

Thales network will reduce cost for users in following way:
1. Every address (not include contract) which balance exceed min balance will have several fee Tx fee per day.;
2. Contract can pay gas fee for user;
3. Gas fee will be anchored with stable coin, and if payed with Thales token, you will has some discount;

## DPos

Thales network will use Dpos consensus.

Thales network have max 21 main node, 11 backup node. 90% token will give to main node, and 10% to backup node. For main node.

## Two main coin: Thales & StableCoin

In the latter version, Thales will with two coin, Thales & StableCoin.

They have different usage, stable coin can only pay gas fee, and thales can pay gas fee, community governance, and more.

## Oracle
Thales will have oracle in later version.

## Run an alphanet node with Docker

Docker images are published for every tagged release. Learn more with `thales --help`.

```bash
# Join the public testnet
docker run --network="host" Thales-network/thales:v0.9 --chain alphanet
```

## Run a local development node with Docker

Developers who are building dApps to run on thales, may want a lightweight node to work with
locally. You can quickly spin up a single node with no relay chain backing it using the development
service.

```bash
# Run a dev service node.
docker run --network="host" Thales-network/thales:v0.9 --dev
```

### Sealing options

The command above will start the node in instant seal mode. It creates a block when a transaction arrives, similar to Ganache's auto-mine. You can also choose to author blocks at a regular interval, or control authoring manually through the RPC.

```bash
# Author a block every 6 seconds.
docker run --network="host" Thales-network/thales:v0.9 --dev --sealing 3000

# Manually control the block authorship and finality
docker run --network="host" Thales-network/thales:v0.9 --dev --sealing manual
```

### Prefunded Development Addresses

Running Thales in development mode will pre-fund several well-known addresses that (mostly) contain the letters "th" in their names to remind you that they are for ethereum-compatible usage. These addresses are derived from
Substrate's canonical mnemonic: `bottom drive obey lake curtain smoke basket hold race lonely fit walk`

## Build the Thales Node

To build Thales, you will need a proper Substrate development environment. If you've never worked
with a Substrate-based blockchain before, you should probably try the [Setting Up a Thales Node](https://docs.thales.network/getting-started/local-node/setting-up-a-node/) docs first. If you
need a refresher setting up your Substrate environment, see [Substrate's Getting Started Guide](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/getting-started/).

```bash
# Fetch the code
git clone https://github.com/Thales-network/thales
cd thales

# Build the node (The first build will be long (~30min))
cargo build --release
```

## Run tests

Thales has Rust unit tests as well as typescript integration tests. These tests are run in CI, and can also be run locally.

```bash
# Run the Rust unit tests
cargo test
```

```bash
# Install dependencies for integration tests
cd thales-types-bundle
npm i

cd ../tests
npm i

# Run integration tests
npm test
```

## Chain IDs

The Ethereum specification described a numeric Chain Id. The Thales mainnet Chain Id will be 624
because thales born in 624.BC.

Thales nodes support multiple public chains and testnets, with the following Chain Ids.

| Network Description                | Chain ID    |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Local Parachain TestNet            | 546        |
| Local Development TestNet          | 547        |
| Reserved for other TestNets        | 548-560    |
| Thales (Polkadot)                  | 624        |
| ThalesKusama (Kusama)              | 623        |
| ThalesRococo (Rococo)              | 622        |
| Thales Alpha TestNet               | 621        |
| Reserved for other public networks | 610-620    |

## Runtime Architecture

The Thales Runtime is built using FRAME and consists of pallets from substrate, frontier, cumulus, and `pallets/`.

From substrate:

- _Utility_: Allows users to use derivative accounts, and batch calls
- _Balances_: Tracks GLMR token balances
- _Sudo_: Allows a privileged account to make arbitrary runtime changes - will be removed before
  launch
- _Timestamp_: On-Chain notion of time
- _Transaction Payment_: Transaction payment (fee) management
- _Randomness Collective Flip_: A (mock) onchain randomness beacon. Will be replaced by parachain
  randomness by mainnet.

From frontier:

- _EVM_: Encapsulates execution logic for an Ethereum Virtual Machine
- _Ethereum_: Ethereum-style data encoding and access for the EVM.

From cumulus:

- _ParachainUpgrade_: A helper to perform runtime upgrades on parachains
- _ParachainInfo_: A place to store parachain-relevant constants like parachain id

The following pallets are stored in `pallets/`. They are designed for Thales's specific requirements:

- _Ethereum Chain Id_: A place to store the chain id for each Thales network
- _Author Inherent_: Allows block authors to include their identity in a block via an inherent
- _Parachain Staking_: Minimal staking pallet that selects collators by total amount at stake
