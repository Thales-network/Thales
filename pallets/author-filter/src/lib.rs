//! Small pallet responsible determining which accounts are eligible to author at the current
//! block height.
//!
//! Currently this pallet is tightly coupled to our stake pallet, but this design
//! should be generalized in the future.
//!
//! Using a randomness beacon supplied by the `Randomness` trait, this pallet takes the set of
//! currently staked accounts from pallet stake, and filters them down to a pseudorandom subset.
//! The current technique gives no preference to any particular author. In the future, we could
//! disfavor authors who are authoring a disproportionate amount of the time in an attempt to
//! "even the playing field".
